I am a PhD Candidate (third year) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California San Diego (UCSD), luckly being advised by [Prof. Bill Lin](http://cwcserv.ucsd.edu/~billlin/).

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and Optimization. My current research focus is on **Federated Learning**, **Generative AI** and **Business**. Here are the research themes that I am currently working on: 

- Large Scale Federated Learning Over Diverse Heterogeneous Devices
- Efficient Training and Fine-tuning of Large Models in Federated Learning
- Inference Speedup for Large Generative Models 
- Effect of Generative AI in Business Market

I previously received a M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCSD in 2021, and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Tehran Polytechnique.

I also working as a machine learning research intern at [Tesla Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) and Qualcomm AI.  

<span style="color: red;">**I am looking for machine learning internship positions for summer 2023.**.</span>

<span style="color: red;">**I am open to collaborate on interesting project, please feel free to reach out.**.</span>
