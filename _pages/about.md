I am a final-year (fifth year) PhD Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California San Diego (UCSD), being advised by [Prof. Bill Lin](http://cwcserv.ucsd.edu/~billlin/).

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Information Systems, Operation Management, and Economics. My current research focus is on **AI in Business** and **Generative AI**. I also actively publish in **Federated Learning** and **Machine Learning**. Here are the research themes that I am currently working on: 

- Causal Learning and Inference in Business and Economics
- Generative AI for Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Analysis
- Optimal Ranking in Online Health Platforms
- Device Heterogenous Federated Learning
- Generative AI for Business Market and Branding
- Decentralized Data Marketplace

I previously received a M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCSD in 2021, and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Tehran Polytechnique.

I also worked as a machine learning research intern at [Tesla Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) and Qualcomm AI.  

<span style="color: red;">**I am looking actively looking for post-doc positions in Business school and machine learning positions.**</span>

<span style="color: red;">**I am open to collaborate on interesting project, please feel free to reach out.**</span>
