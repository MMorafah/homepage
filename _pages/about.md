I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/">Institute for Machine Learning</a> at the <a href="http://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a>, working on reliable machine learning research.

I received my PhD in Computer and Communication Sciences under the supervision of <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.frossard">Pascal Frossard</a> at the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a>, Switzerland. My PhD research focused on the analysis of the robustness of classifiers and its connection with the geometry of deep networks. I was also fortunate to intern for the Apple AI Research in 2017, working on autonomous technologies.

I received my M.S. degree in Communication Systems from the EPFL in 2014 where I worked as a research assistant under the supervision of <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/martin.vetterli">Martin Vetterli</a>. In 2012, I got my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en">Tehran Polytechnic</a>, Iran.
