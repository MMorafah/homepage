I am a second year PhD Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California San Diego (UCSD), luckly being advised by [Prof. Bill Lin](http://cwcserv.ucsd.edu/~billlin/).

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and Optimization. My current research focus is on **Federated Learning**. Here are several federated learning themes that I am currently working on: 

- Statistical Heterogeneity (Non-I.I.D)
- Personalization
- Communication Effeciency 
- Optimization

I previously received a M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCSD in 2021, and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Tehran Polytechnique.

I also enjoyed working as machine learning research intern at [Tesla Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot).  

<span style="color: red;">**I am looking for internship positions for summer 2022. Please feel free to reach out**.</span>
