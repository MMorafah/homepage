  abstract={The traditional approach in FL tries to learn a single global model collaboratively
            with the help of many clients under the orchestration of a central server. However,
            learning a single global model might not work well for all clients participating in
            the FL under data heterogeneity. Therefore, the personalization of the global model
            becomes crucial in handling the challenges that arise with statistical heterogeneity
            and the non-IID distribution of data. Unlike prior works, in this work we propose a
            new approach for obtaining a personalized model from a client-level objective. This
            further motivates all clients to participate in federation even under statistical het-
            erogeneity in order to improve their performance, instead of merely being a source
            of data and model training for the central server. To realize this personalization,
            we leverage finding a small subnetwork for each client by applying hybrid pruning
            (combination of structured and unstructured pruning), and unstructured pruning.
            Through a range of experiments on different benchmarks, we observed that the
            clients with similar data (labels) share similar personal parameters. By finding a
            subnetwork for each client rather than taking the average over all parameters of
            all clients for the entire federation as in traditional FL, we efficiently calculate the
            averaging on the remaining parameters of each subnetwork of each client. We
            call this novel parameter averaging as Sub-FedAvg. Furthermore, in our proposed
            approach, the clients are not required to have knowledge of any underlying data
            distributions or label similarities among the rest of clients. The non-IID nature of
            each clientâ€™s local data provides distinguishing subnetworks without sharing any
            data. We evaluate our method on federated image classification with real world
            datasets. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
